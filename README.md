Progressive Web Applications (PWA)

# Description
This project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) which allows for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online.
